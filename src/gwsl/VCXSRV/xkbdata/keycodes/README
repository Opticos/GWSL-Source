The keycodes component of a keyboard mapping specifies the range and
interpretation of the raw keycodes reported by the device. It sets the keycodes
symbolic name, the minimum and maximum legal codes for the keyboard, and the
symbolic name for each key. The keycodes component might also contain aliases
for some keys, symbolic names for some indicators and a description of which
indicators are physically present.
