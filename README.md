The actual code for GWSL. And some premade binaries.

See assets/liceses.txt to see licenses for dependencies (VCXSRV and PUTTY) etc.

I know this is messy but bear with me. This is my first open-source project.

Please contact me if anything in the licenses is incorrect or confusing.

Not all files are uploaded yet!
